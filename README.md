Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits. They perform basic logical functions and are essential in creating complex electronic systems. Each gate takes one or more binary inputs (0 or 1) and produces a single binary output based on a specific logic function, such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR. The behavior of these gates can be described using truth tables that show all possible input combinations and their corresponding outputs. Logic gates are typically implemented using transistors in modern electronics and are found in everything from simple circuits to complex computing devices.

Different types of logic gates perform distinct operations. For example, an AND gate outputs a 1 only when all its inputs are 1, while an OR gate outputs a 1 if at least one input is 1. The NOT gate, also known as an inverter, produces the opposite of its input. Combining these basic gates enables the creation of more complex logic circuits, such as multiplexers, decoders, and arithmetic units within processors. These gates are critical to digital technology, allowing devices to process information, make decisions, and perform calculations automatically.
